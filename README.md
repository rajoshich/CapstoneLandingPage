# Sound Sustainability: Hearing Aid Application
Landing Page for iSchool Capstone 2021 submission.

### As four UW iSchool students who have strong interest in accessibility, our group wishes to help people who try to find hearing sustainable solutions and who are willing to learn more about hearing health and achieving helpful resources to prevent hearing loss in the future. In partnership with our sponsor Sound Sustainability, a Seattle-based medical device startup founded by a hearing-impaired Army veteran Robert White, we hope hearing-impaired individuals achieve a better understanding of hearing health and information about the necessary resources so that they can have an improved quality of life.

For our project, we focused on creating an emulated mobile application that would be used to pair with Sound Sustainability's OTC hearing aids, and allow for the user to control their hearing aids from their smartphone.
